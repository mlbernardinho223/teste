<ul>
    <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
    <li>Describe your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it appropriately.</li>

The information we provide only covers the 12-month period prior to receipt of the consumer's verifiable request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons why we are unable to accommodate a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format for providing your personal information that is easily usable and that allows you to transmit the information from one entity to another without hindrance. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will provide you with the reason for our decision and provide you with an estimate of the cost before completing your request.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>

    <li>Suggest to you that you may receive a different price or rate for the goods or services or a different level or quality of the same.</li>
</ul>
